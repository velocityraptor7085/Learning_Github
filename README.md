# THIS IS A HEADING!

This is text that describes the project and the organization of its code , etc.....


## this is a subheading.
More text.

## subheading from feature branch 1
It is often a good idea to delete merged / stale branches to avoid clutter and complicating the github branch workflow.

## After merging to main (thorugh a pull request)
Notice that we did:
- Clone github repo to local device in VS Code
- Make changes to main, check status, add changes, commit changes and push to github
- Created a feature branch with changes and pushed the branch to github
- Merged the changes files to the main branch by creating and accepting a pull request on github
- But, the feature branch changes that were merged to github's main branch need to be updated in the local project as well
  {this is done using the git pull origin main command}
